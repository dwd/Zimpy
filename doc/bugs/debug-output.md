# Debug output for XMPP errors

When connection or other XMPP-related errors occur, I'd like to know if it's my server or my client that's at fault (or possibly some external factor).

On Linux, I was able to get a console text stream. I'd like access to some debug info on Android or other OSes, including before successful authentication.
